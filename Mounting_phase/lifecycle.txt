life cycle of components:

3-phases:
1.mounting phase

 a.constructor 
   this is the first method called in the component
 b.getDerivedStateFromProps 
   this will update the state depending on the props
 c.render:
   it will render the component in the browser
 d.componentDidMount
   this method is used to perform side effects
   this will render the component only once after the render
   eg:api calls, event listeners

2.updating phase 
3.unmounting phase
