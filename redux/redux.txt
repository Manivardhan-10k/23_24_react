context:




redux  react-redux



Principle of Redux:

1.  state is read-only 
2.  it has a single source of truth
3.  state can only be updated by pure functions



Boilerplate code:
1. action
   actions are js functions that return a  object {type:incerement ,payload:}

    
2. reducer
   it is a pure function that takes  two parameters initial state and action
   



3. store
   it is the global state for the react app
